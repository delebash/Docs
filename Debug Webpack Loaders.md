## Install @easy-webpack sass ##
    npm install @easy-webpack/config-sass

**Add easy webpack sass to webpack.config.js and comment out css version**
**MAKE SURE:** you do this in development section

     require('@easy-webpack/config-sass')
        ({ filename: 'styles.css', allChunks: !!ELECTRON, sourceMap: false, extractText: true }),

## Compile css-load ts files on change ##

**First make sure typescript 2.0 is install**

    npm install typescript@next

**install typings in the easy-webpack/config-sass directory**

typings install in the node_modules/@easy-webpack/config-sass folder using commander

## Use manual tsc compiler ##
open second jetbrains terminal or run in cmder

    tsc --p "F:\Development\GitHub\delebash\Webpack-debug\skeleton-esnext-webpack\node_modules\@easy-webpack\config-sass"
    
src and out put files are set in tsconfig.json so all you need to do for running tsc is point to the root folder were tsconfig.json is located by using the  --p parameter

## If you get errors running tsc  ##
make sure typescript 2.0 is installed and typings under the config-sass folder is installed
